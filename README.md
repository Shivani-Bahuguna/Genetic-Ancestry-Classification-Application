# Genetic-Ancestry-Classification-Application
This is a prediction application designed to find an individual's ancestorial origins based on genetic data.

The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle.

Technology used : Data Analysis and Machine Learning

Exploratory Data Analysis : Involves data cleaning and preprocessing features to suitable format for model training and testing.

Data Visualisation : Done through matplotlib and seaborn 

Predictive Data Analysis : Building machine learning models using various classification algorithms and choosing the one with the most appropriate prediction score.

The LogisticRegression model is found to give a score of 1.0 for the given dataset and hence is used for predictions.

The model is integrated into a web UI using flask.

Predictions are made on the web UI by collecting genetic information from the user.
