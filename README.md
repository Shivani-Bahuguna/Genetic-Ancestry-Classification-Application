# Genetic-Ancestry-Prediction-Application
This is a prediction application designed to find an individual's ancestorial origins based on genetic data.
The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle.
Technology used : Data Analysis and Machine Learning
Exploratory Data Analysis : Involves data cleaning and preprocessing features to suitable format.
Data Visualisation : Done through matplotlib and seaborn 
Predictive Data Analysis : Building machine learning models using various classification algorithms and choosing the one with the most appropriate prediction score.

The model is integrated into a web UI using flask.
Predictions are made on the web UI by collecting genetic information from the user.
